## Blockchain Mining Visualizer

This application serves to help visualize how mining works in a proof-of-work based blockchain, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

```npm start``` - Deploys webpack which supports live hotloading


1. After running ```npm start```, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. The page will take some time in mining the initial genesis block. If this takes too long, try lowering the difficulty. This can be changed in ```src/config.js```
3. Give some input data to mine the next block. Once calculated, it will be displayed on the page


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
